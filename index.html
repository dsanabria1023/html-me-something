			<h1>Top 5 Scariest Bosses in Bloodborne</h1>

		    <p>Every boss in Bloodborne is scary in one way or another. Some bosses aren't terribly difficult, but their design is the stuff of nightmares (The One, Reborn comes to mind immediately). Others elicit fear from players by how hard they hit rather than having an imposing figure (Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower is a fellow Hunter who can take the player down in one swift combo). But there are a few bosses in the game that are, to me, the complete package. Here are my top 5 scariest bosses in Bloodborne:</p>
            <ol>
                <l5>5. Vicar Amelia
            	    <figure><img src=images/amelia.jpg/></figure>
				    <p>Bloodborne's fourth boss (or second, depending on the path you take) projects a horrifying battle right away. Her introductory cutscene is quite unsettling, and ranks very highly among the rest from the main game and The Old Hunters DLC.</p>
                    <p>While her design post-transformation is quite scary, what puts her on this shortlist is one specific ability she has. Some smart use of fire paper can bring down her health pretty significantly, but after losing so much you might see Vicar Amelia do something like this:</p>
                    <figure><img src=images/healing.gif/></figure>
                    <p>That there is a healing spell. And anyone who has played any of From Software's recent titles knows how terrifying a boss having a healing spell is. This spell can be countered with a well placed numbing mist, if you happened to come across one before this fight. But this spell can be completely demoralizing to the player or worse - it could be the difference between life and death.</p>
                </l5>
                <l4>4. Father Gascoigne
                    <figure><img src=images/gascoigne.jpg/></figure>
                    <p>Father Gascoigne could possibly be the first boss a player faces, and what an experience that would be. Unlike Vicar Amelia, Gascoigne is (or was) a Hunter, just like the player. And he fights like the player would fight. His moves are very similar, if not exactly the same, as the moves the player would use. Heck, his weapon is even one of the weapons you can choose to take after your first trip to the Hunter's Dream. But that's what makes this fight so scary: you're fighting a better version of yourself. At least, that's the case in the first two stages of the fight. Then this happens:</p>
                    <figure><img src=images/beasthood.gif/></figure>
                    <p>Gascoigne completely turns the tables on you once he loses enough health and gives in to the Beasthood. It's an absolutely horrifying turn of events, as he grows to three times his normal size and attacks with such ferocity it's hard to get a beat on. But conquering this fight is rewarding in a way that is hard for other games to match, and it's genuinely one of my favorite fights in the game.</p>
                </l4>
                <l3>3. Orphan of Kos
                    <figure><img src=images/orphan.jpg/></figure>
                    <p>The final boss of the amazing Old Hunters DLC, the Orphan of Kos - like Vicar Amelia - is introduced with an unsettling cutscene:</p>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEfGB5W2tOk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <p>Yikes.</p>
                    <p>But as scary as that was, it's honestly nothing compared to the fight itself. The Orphan's weapon - an organ from its now dead mother - has an astounding range and hits hard whether you're up close or at a distance. Even worse, that weapon is paired with an extremely aggressive opponent. The Orphan is almost constantly in the process of attacking, which only becomes more quick and ferocious in the second stage of the battle. I felt like I spent much more time dodging attacks than performing them, making this a battle where guerilla tactics are the key to victory. You just have to (somehow) stay alive long enough to put them into practice.</p>
                </l3>
                <l2>2. Ludwig, The Accursed / Ludwig, The Holy Blade
                    <figure><img src=images/ludwig.jpg/></figure>
                    <p>Another fight that projects bad news before the cutscene is triggered. Found with heaping piles of bodies at the end of a gutter flowing with blood, this absolutely monstrosity it the definition of the stuff of nightmares. Random body parts are grafted onto this wolf/horse/human hybrid thing, and it has a second mouth made of teeth and eyeballs. But perhaps the scariest thing about Ludwig's design - though not right away - is the foreshadowing of the second stage of the fight represented by the blade on his back.</p>
                    <p>All that said, and I haven't even talked about the fight yet, which is just as much of a nightmare. Like the Orphan of Kos, Ludwig is in an almost constant state of attacking, putting his entire massive form into attacks that hit like a freight train. Things somehow get worse when he realizes he has a sword, which adds a ton of damage to his attacks as well as some arcane area-of-effect attacks that can take you out in one hit if you're too close to him. It's one of the only bosses in the game where I relied on the help of a computer-controlled ally to keep him occupied while I just wailed on him. It really is a battle of attrition.</p>
                </l2>
                <l1>1. Martyr Logarius
                    <figure><img src=images/logarius.jpg/></figure>
                    <p>The undead keeper of Cainhurst Castle, Martyr Logaruis isn't the most physically imposing boss in the game - apart from his abnormal height. His physical attacks aren't as strong as those of the Orphan of Kos or Ludwig, either. What makes Logarius scary is his use of magic in combination with his physical attacks. He has the ability to cast a spell - which isn't too difficult to dodge on its own - then run up and draw you out of your “cover”. This can lead to physical damage from his sword plus damage from his ranged spell he cast a few seconds ago, and that can pile up very quickly if you're not careful. Even worse, he can cast a magical buff on himself later in the fight that makes the player unable to interrupt his attacks or stagger him for an opportunity for visceral attacks. This makes it a truly harrowing task to empty the last third of his health bar, and one that left me literally shaking once I was able to accomplish it.</p>
